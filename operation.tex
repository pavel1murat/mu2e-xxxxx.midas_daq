\section{Starting and stopping a run: operational procedures }

\begin{itemize}
\item
  request the next run number from the Mu2e run conditions database
  (MIDAS sequencer ==> config/scripts/get\_next\_run\_number.py) and store
  it in ODB (rn-1)
\item
  configure the detector using the sequencer scripts.
  When the system will become stable enough, the configuration functionality
  could be moved to the frontends.
\item
  start the run. At this point the detector is configured and ready to be read out.
  The TFM frontend starts the ARTDAQ processes , after which the CFO frontend 
  initiates new run plan.
\item
  to stop the run, the CFO frontend terminates execution of the run plan
  by the CFO, after that the TFM frontend ends the run and the TFM terminates
  the ARTDAQ processes.
\end{itemize}
