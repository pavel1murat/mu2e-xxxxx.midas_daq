\section {Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  The MIDAS+ARTDAQ solution for the Mu2e DAQ has been extensively prototyped.
\item
  this system is significantly simpler for both users and developers
\item
  current functionality of the described system, in many aspects,
  already exceeds that of the OTSDAQ-based system  
\item
  collaboration members, including students, are contributing
  to the development process. 
\item
  new collaboration members joining Mu2e from other muon experiment will
  likely have an experience of operating a MIDAS-based DAQ
\end{itemize}

Based on our assessment, a combination of MIDAS and  ARTDAQ provides
the best solution for the Mu2e DAQ,  the system which the collaboration
will be able to maintain and operate over the course of the Mu2e data taking.

\vspace{0.2in}
We therefore propose to exercise the MIDAS+ARTDAQ based system in the upcoming GR4
to demonstrate its functionality and determine next development steps.
