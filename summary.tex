\section {Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item 
  The MIDAS+ARTDAQ solution for the Mu2e DAQ has been extensively prototyped.
\item
  the solution is significantly simpler for both the users and the developers
\item
  its current functionality, in many respects, already exceeds that
  of the current OTSDAQ-based system  
\item
  collaboration members, including students, are contributing
  to the development process. 
\item
  new collaboration members joining Mu2e from other muon experiment will
  likely have an experience of operating a MIDAS-based DAQ
\end{itemize}

Based on our assessment, a combination of MIDAQ and  ARTDAQ
provides the best solution for the Mu2e DAQ.

We therefore propose to exercise this solution and demonstrate
its functionality in the upcoming GR4.
