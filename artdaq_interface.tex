\section{Interface to ARTDAQ}

ARTDAQ processes are controlled by the special MIDAS ``
Trigger Farm Manager (TFM) frontend'', tfm\_launch\_fe.py.

The TFM frontend runs the TFM manager which inherits the functionality
of artdaq\_daqinterface, providing an interface between the MIDAS-based
run control system and ARTDAQ.

The TFM reads its initial settings from ODB. its configuration path is "/Mu2e/ActiveRunConfiguration/DAQ/Tfm"
