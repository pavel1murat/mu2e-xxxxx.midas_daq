\subsection{Tracker} 

A top view of the tracker configuration is shown in Figure~\ref{figure:tracker_config}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] at (0,0.) {
      % \node[shift={(0 cm,0.cm)},inner sep=0,rotate={90}] at (0,0) {}
      \makebox[\textwidth][c] {
        \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{png/tracker_config}
      }
    };
    % \node [text width=8cm, scale=1.0] at (14.5,0.5) {$\mu_B$, expected background mean};
    % \node [text width=8cm, scale=1.0, rotate={90}] at (1.5,7.5) { $S_{D}$, ``discovery'' signal strength  };
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{

    Tracker: configuration levels from the station down to the panel, .
  }
\end{figure}


Lower levels of the tracker configuration hierarchy are shown in Figure~\ref{figure:station_config}.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[anchor=south west,inner sep=0] at (0,0.) {
      % \node[shift={(0 cm,0.cm)},inner sep=0,rotate={90}] at (0,0) {}
      \makebox[\textwidth][c] {

      }
    };
    % \node [text width=8cm, scale=1.0] at (14.5,0.5) {$\mu_B$, expected background mean};
    % \node [text width=8cm, scale=1.0, rotate={90}] at (1.5,7.5) { $S_{D}$, ``discovery'' signal strength  };
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{
    \label{figure:station_config}
    Tracker configuration. The tracker, as well as each of the stations, has ``Enabled'' and
    ``Status'' fields.
