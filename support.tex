\section{Support considerations}

MIDAS has first been introduced about 30 years ago and has been used
by multiple experiments. It is used by the experiments at TRIUMF, PSI,
and CERN. Has been used by g-2. Currently is used by MEG, will be used by the Mu3e experiment which will have
a close to Mu2e structure of the DAQ.
It evolved over time, its architecture is advanced and uses modern software
technologies (HTML5, Javascript, Ajax).
It is supported on Windows, Macs and Linux.
Expect active support to continue over the lifetime of Mu2e.
